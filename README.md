Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI searches Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies from requests to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs.

liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

   * `concert-this` - provides event dates for an artist specified by user

   * `spotify-this-song` - provides song info for song specified by user

   * `movie-this` - provides movie info for movie specified by user

   * `do-what-it-says` - reads text file to execute one of the above commands
